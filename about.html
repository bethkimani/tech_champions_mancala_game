    <h1>About Mancala</h1>
    <p>Mancala is a strategy board game that has been played for centuries. The objective is to capture more stones than your opponent. The game involves moving stones from one pit to another, with the goal of collecting them in your store.</p>
    <p>Each player takes turns picking up stones from one of their pits and distributing them one by one into the subsequent pits, including their store. Special rules apply when landing in empty pits and capturing stones.</p>
    <p>This implementation of Mancala allows for two players to compete against each other, taking turns until all the stones are captured. The player with the most stones in their store at the end wins!</p>
